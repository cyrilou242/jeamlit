we will now implement the toggle component 

spec: 
Display a toggle widget. 

label: from the backend component, it's an html string because it's converted from 
markdown to html. In the frontend, use the same logic to inject the html as in 
ButtonComponent. 

help: A tooltip that gets displayed next to the widget label. Jeamlit only displays
the tooltip when label_visibility="visible". If this is None (default), no tooltip is 
displayed. The help string  is NOT markdown. In the frontend, use the same 
implementation as in the ButtonComponent.

disabled: boolean: An optional boolean that disables the toggle if set to True. The 
default is False. 

label_visibility: The visibility of the label. The default is "visible". If this is 
"hidden", jeamlit displays an empty spacer instead of the label, which can help keep 
the widget aligned with other widgets. If this is "collapsed", jeamlit displays no 
label or spacer.  the same implementation as in the TextAreaComponent 

width: String: "content", "stretch" or an int string. Use the same implementation as 
in the CodeComponent in the frontend.
